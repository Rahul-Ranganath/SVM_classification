Got a lot of compliments, I have to get a second pair! I LOVE IT!!!!!
Need a smaller size. But I love the shoes!!
Bad material, its look old.
worst shoes I ever bought.  They stretched out within 3 wearing and after 5, the stitching came out leaving them unwearable.  total junk!!
NOT REAL LEATHER!  They look like they are leather but they are not.  The shoes are narrow, but I think its listed as a B width, so that is probably correct.  ALSO, the inside foot liner is nothing but CARDBOARD!  Strong plastic odor.  Already processing the return.
The shoes are way too small.  I should have bought a larger size, my big toe is not only touching but is slightly bent.
Worst product Ive ever purchased through Amazon. Cheap and terrible.
DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY LADIES!  I only gave them one star because they are cute.  To be able to walk in them, you would have to secure them on your foot with a rope.
I have bought these same shoes from another seller, I wore them to work every day for 6 months and loved them. I ordered from this seller and not 3 wears later the stitches have come out and they are no longer wearable. Needless to say I am vary vary disappointed.
I loved these shoes and bought another style but these ripped down the side and not on a seam
Your feet loks like  way to crooked. its  like they are so bend  to the inside. no confortable at all.Bought them for long walks on different surfaces. They are just perfect on bare feet and look good. Will order again.
Great fit and looks nice
Very nice and comfortable shoes. So simple and yet so stylish.
Comfy, but it's a little big
Nice & light, good fit. Accidentally bought two pair & decided to keep both
Love them! very comfortable too!
LOVE LOVE LOVE these shoes!
I love, love, love these shoes! They are excellent and super comfortable!
Great shoes
